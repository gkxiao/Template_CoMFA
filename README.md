<p>The 'tcfa' program performs the template CoMFA alignments themselves. Although its alignment algorithm significantly differs from the one described in the references, its output produces very similar models.</p>

<p>The 'comfa' program performs the same default workflow that Sybyl formerly provided, including Gasteiger-Huckel charge calculation, steric and electrostatic field sampling, SAMPLS-assisted model generation, prediction, and visualization support.</p>

<p>Both programs are command-line utilities, thus deployable in any environment, and are provided in C++ source code form, to be built using CMakeLists.txt as described in Open Eye's C++ Toolkits documentation. Access to Open Eye's C++ API is of course required, for both building and running these programs. Both codes have been built in OSX and Linux (Ubuntu) environments, but not tried in Windows. The contents of the 'data' directory are provided for validating these builds.</p>
